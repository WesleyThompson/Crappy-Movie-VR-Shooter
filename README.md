## A Really Shitty Movie: The Game (working title)
THIS GAME ONLY SUPPORTS THE HTC VIVE CURRENTLY
Survive the takes of a crappy, low-budget film.

Congratulations! You've landed the star role in Agent X, the next blockbuster film in Hollywood...or so you thought. After signing your contract, you realize the movie is not what it seems. Now with only a few hours to look at the script, you've been thrown into the most critical scene of the movie, the zombie attack. Your only defense is two pistols (that fire blanks of course) against the horde.

This is a VR Shooter game we made in less than 48 hours.
